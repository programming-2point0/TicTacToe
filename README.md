# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe done right

This is the version of Tic Tac Toe that I did right - by actually following the Perfect Programming Process, as documented in https://youtube.com/watch?v=ertvnBmwPTY

The code isn't elegant, there's way to much copy-paste going on, almost exact duplication of the two check winner parts, and lots of other repetition.
But future versions will showcase how to make even better solutions - this one is only focused on actually getting the program to work, and it does!
